dupload TODO
------------

* Improve hook system:
  - Rewrite several dupload features, such as announcements, as hooks.
  - Make it possible to run perl modules in addition to shell commands.
  - Make it possible to specify a list of hooks per category, so that one can
    do «$preupload{changes} = [ 'check-a %1', 'check-b %1' ];» where all
    hooks must pass. Preserve backwards compatibility.
  - Move distribution check to be a pre-defiend hook, or a vendor hook or
    similar.

* Refactor uploader methods into Perl modules.

* Add new uploader methods:
  - local upload support, so that we can do easy automated testing.
  - FTP via HTTP proxy.
  - HTTP, HTTPS.
  - SFTP.

* Switch to use libdpkg-perl Perl modules.

* Add a new command to generate DAK or archive specific control commands,
  possible names, could be drecall, dacl, etc.

* Use the dpkg vendor system to select default configurations and hosts.
  - Create new /etc/dupload.conf.d/<vendor>.conf style loading, perhaps?
  - dinstall_run could be implicitly set for Debian vendor.
  - Improve mailto/mailtx mess, it should be vendor and/or host specific,
    not a global hardcoded handling thing.

* Add archive attribute information so that additional checks or features
  can be enabled on those.

* Add a hook that requests confirmation for the Debian security hosts, so
  that these can be uncommented by default, and the hook removed or overridden
  in a local config, instead of needing to copy&paste the entire entries.

* Obsolete --configfile, and transition to require a filename argument to use.

* Think about switching from a perl "config" to a proper declarative config
  format.
