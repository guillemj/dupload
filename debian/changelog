  * Remove trailing spaces from changelog file.
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 11.

  * Add configuration stanza for Debian Ports archive.
    Prompted by Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <mafm@debian.org>.
  * Check the distribution values one at a time.
  * Add new configuration options (distwhitelist and distblacklist) to
    check for the distributions (not) allowed per host.

    uploads. Closes: #647130
  * Remove done items from the TODO list.
  * Automatically select the default host based on the current vendor, when
    that is Debian or Ubuntu.
  * Clarify that the "Login and password" man page subsection is FTP-specific.
  * Document the anonymous FTP password host option.
  * Only set the ssh login name if specified in the dupload config. We should
    delegate the username to either the ssh host configuration or the dupload
    configuration. Trying to use the current system login name, or one of
    LOGNAME or USER confuses and annoys users, and makes them have to
    duplicate the information which is already kept in the ssh config.
    Closes: #63130, #100460, #504175
  * Fix quiet mode to be consistent across upload methods. Pass -q to scp
    only when quiet is enabled, which changes the default behavior for the
    «scp» method that was always passing -q, and for the «scpb» method that
    was never passing it. For the «rsync» method we now pass -v only when
    quiet is not set. Closes: #61324
  * Output the database entries with --print in a deterministic order.
  * Fix --help output to document the <file> argument to --configfile.
  * Perl code cleanup:
    - Remove unused variables in ftp_open().
    - Use ftp_open() function argument instead of global variable.
    - Make $ftp a local variable in ftp_open().
    - Only handle the password setting in FTP-method specific code path.

  * Perl code cleanup:

    and
    https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/debian-devel-200401/msg01950.html>
    also cleaned up the bug list.
  * Removed non-functioning upload queues: anonymous-non-us, non-us,
    chiark, erlangen, uk, jp, and samosa. (Closes: #222938, #229744)
  * Added notes extracted from the Developer's reference regarding
    uploads to security and commented out these entries to prevent
    developers from uploading there unintentionally. (Closes: #251286)
  * Added a default configuration for uploading to mentors.debian.net
    (Closes: #226101)
  * Changed default (commented) upload queue to be anonymous-ftp-master
  * Use Goswin's patch to add an 'options' field in the configuration file
    which can be used to setup --progress and -L in rsync calls, or
    additional options to SSH if needed (Closes: #98949, #319910, #225400)
  * Check the .changes signature using gpg or pgp (if available) in order to
    prevent unsigned uploads. This is active by default for GPG but can be
    disabled in dupload.conf at will. Also, added two new simple scripts
    gpg-check and pgp-check to provide a wrapper to the check so that the
    error message in case of a failure is more user-friendly. I've implemented
    this as hooks rather than as new code in dupload to allow users to
    customise as needed. Note: DSC files are not checked since that should
    be done in a separate hook (and there is none for those files).
    (Closes: #54344, #56877, #65630, #101882)
  * Related to the above add references to the preupload/postupload hooks
    in the dupload.conf file.

  * Removed giano from the configuration file, closes: #122777.
  * Use the host FQDN instead of the host nickname in .upload files,

  * Polishing in the packaging.
  * Removed fucked up makefile commands that overwrote my dupload with the
    contents of dupload.pl for no actual practical purpose. Fuck.
  * Removed checking of the Format: field in the changes file for >= 1.6,
    since the fact dinstall's mails started somewhere at about the same time
    is not really related. Simply respect the $dinstall_runs variable which
    is set for all the default Debian hosts in the configuration file.

dupload (2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch (both from Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net> and myself) to fix hooks.
    Hooks are now seriously tested. Closes: #43644
  * $dinstall_runs is now set for every host which transfers to master.
    Closes #43722.
  * The fact that the "scpb" method is the recommended one is now clear
    in dupload(1). Closes #42342.

  * Complies with the new Perl policy. Closes #40563

 -- Stephane Bortzmeyer <bortzmeyer@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 14:17:15 +0200

dupload (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * A completely new system to run pre and post-upload scripts: hooks.
    Now, you can run any shell command before uploading (uploading will
    be cancelled if they fail) and after successful uploading.
    See dupload.conf(5). Closes #34883 and, I hope, almost all the future
    wishlists "Can you add such and such in dupload" :-)
  * Small improvement to the automatic changelog detection code. Closes
    #39072
  * Several cleanings of the source code and dependencies, thanks to
    Julian Gilbey <J.D.Gilbey@qmw.ac.uk>
  * New upload queue samosa.debian.org. Closes #38838

dupload (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recognizes the new (1.6) changelog format and, if used and if the
    per-host variable dinstall_runs is set, do not send mail uselessly.
    Patch by Brian Almeida <bma@debian.org>. Closes #35308
  * Implements --quiet. Patch by Julian Gilbey <J.D.Gilbey@qmw.ac.uk>
  * Adds a new line to the .upload file to record successful uploading.
    Patch by Julian Gilbey <J.D.Gilbey@qmw.ac.uk>. Closes #34209
  * New global configuration variable default_host. --to is no longer
    mandatory. Closes #34208 and probably #31684 by a side-effect.
  * New option --mailonly for unconditional announcements. Closes
    #31616
  * Allows a new global configuration variable to suppress
    parentheses around full names. Closes #16685
  * ssh no longer requires X forwarding. Closes #38061
  * dupload(5) -> dupload.conf(5) and updated. Closes #35643
  * Fatal error handling rewritten: util.pm suppressed but it is not
    a complete return to pre-2.0: fatal() now uses caller() instead
    of croaking (patch by Julian Gilbey <J.D.Gilbey@qmw.ac.uk>).
    Closes #35626 and #35625 by a side-effect.
  * Properly documents the extra 'announce' files. Closes #26685
  * Japanese upload queue added. Closes #37803
  * Mode-optimization for ssh (do not remote-chmod if the mode is already
    correct) now works also for the 'scpb' method. Allows to close #13243,
    longest dupload bug ever, 604 days old.
  * Announcements are sent according to the Debian Developer's Reference and
    documented as such (there is nothing in the Policy Manual about
    announcements). Closes #37521
  * New way to set the passive mode. Should close #36087
  * Copyright updated (again, pre-2.0 souvenirs). Closes #35603
  * Moved to subsection 'devel'. Closes #35602
  * Various typos fixed, as well as errors in the documentation
    (mostly pre-2.0 souvenirs).	Closes #35518

dupload (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New dependencies: recommends a mail-transport-agent (the
    announcement is really important) and suggests lintian
    (see #34883).
  * When using SSH, do not chmod on the remote host if the local mode
    is already 0644. Half-closes #13243.
  * Patch from Chris Waters <xtifr@dsp.net> to prevent emacs from
    showing password. Closes #34248.
  * scpb method documented.
  * --nomail now works according to the documentation (running
    dupload again sends the announce). Closes #31616, #32977.
  * New configuration file options, "archive" (the announcement)
    and "passive" (for FTP).
  * Do not ask for password when doing a dry run. Closes #31597
  * Routines that croak() are now in a separate package, to avoid
    displaying the stack, with its passwords. Thanks to
    Guy Decoux <decoux@moulon.inra.fr>. Closes #10003
  * New dupload.conf. Closes #34943
  * Now uses Net::FTP module instead of a custom FTP module. And
    depends on libnet-perl. Uses better error messages. Closes
    #28283, #7541, #33437

  * New (undocumented) method "scpb" by Guy Maor <maor@ece.utexas.edu>.
