I've taken these two modules from the mirror package:
- dupload-ftp.pl is (according to a notice in the first lines of
  the module) mostly by Lee McLoughlin <lmjm@doc.ic.ac.uk> based on
  original version by Alan R. Martello <al@ee.pitt.edu> and by
  A.Macpherson@bnr.co.uk for multi-homed hosts.
- lchat.pl is (according to the lchat module) by Randal L. Schwartz
  et al.
