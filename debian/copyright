I've taken these two modules from the mirror package:
- dupload-ftp.pl is (according to a notice in the first lines of
  the module) mostly by Lee McLoughlin <lmjm@doc.ic.ac.uk> based on
  original version by Alan R. Martello <al@ee.pitt.edu> and by
  A.Macpherson@bnr.co.uk for multi-homed hosts.
- lchat.pl is (according to the lchat module) by Randal L. Schwartz
  et al.  

They are no longer used by dupload (since version 2.0) and so their
copyright no longer matters. On the other hand, dupload now depends
(but does not include) libnet-perl. See its copyright in 
/usr/doc/libnet-perl/copyright.
