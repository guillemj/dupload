Description: Debian package upload tool
 dupload will automagically upload Debian packages to a remote host with
 a Debian upload queue. All uploads are logged into a dedicated .upload file.
 The default host is configurable, along with:
 .
  * the upload method,
  * queue and incoming directories,
  * file modes,
  * keyrings for allowed signatures,
  * list of .changes distributions allowed or blocked from upload,
  * whether to send announcement mails or to delegate that to the remote host,
  * and it can be further extended via pre- and post-uploads hooks.
 .
 The following hooks are configured out-of-the box, depending on the remote
 host to use:
 .
  * OpenPGP checks.
  * Debian source-only upload checks.
  * Debian security queue upload confirmation.
  * Debian ongoing transition checks.
  * Debian dinstall next run time notification.
 .
 This tool is intended mainly for people maintaining Debian packages, but
 not necessarily only for the Debian archive.
