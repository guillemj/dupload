dupload (2.13.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  The hook to check OpenPGP signatures before upload has been switched to
  use the dpkg OpenPGP multi-backend support, so now it can use Sequoia-PGP,
  any of the programs implementing the Stateless OpenPGP CLI (SOP), or
  GnuPG and its verification only command.

  This requires an explicit keyring configured for any host using this hook,
  although all default hosts in /etc/dupload.conf that use such hook come
  with pre-configured keyrings, provided by the distribution keyring packages.
  If a certificate for the key used to sign the uploads is not on those
  keyrings, the certificate might need to be exported into an OpenPGP keyring
  and an explicit entry added for that host.
